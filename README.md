# DRIVANA WEB APP

This project is a reservation and document management system that allows users to book reservations and upload required documents. The system ensures that users provide exactly three documents (DNI, license, and address proof), validating and updating them as needed. The frontend is built with React, while the backend is powered by JSON Server for mock API functionality.
